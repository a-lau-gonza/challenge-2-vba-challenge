# Stock Tickers: Rise and Fall with VBA

## Overview of Project
  As Steve had found out during the module that his parents' stocks in Daqo have dropped over 63% in 2018 and wanted to help them make a better investment. The module and challenge had made use of the data that Steve had collected in order to provide a basis on how to create helpful macros to organize, format, and calculate data without having to implement the GUI at every step and accomplish these tasks in a timely manner.

### Purpose
  Utilizing VBA in Excel makes calculating, formatting and organizing data happen at the _click_ of a macro button. Without the use of such macros, the time taken to go through each task with the GUI provided manually would take far longer. It is a fair go to remember the common adage that "time is money".
    
  In the case of Steve and his parents, using VBA macros can help them see the ups and downs of the stock market in a fraction of a second. Giving them much more time needed to deliberate on which to invest in!

## Analysis
  In the case of 2017, it was an overall good year for the stocks that they had gathered data for. With every one improving their year end value, except for the ticker, TERP. With the value of return from Steve's parents' stake in DQ proving to be nearly **_200%_** more than it was at its starting price. However, its total daily volume was the lowest of every other ticker there.
   
  The initial inspection on what Steve's parents' had invested in was great! Having a phenomenal return at year's end.

  However, looking at the performance in 2018 shows a different story. The only profitable stocks of that year, based on the return, was _ENPH_ and _RUN_. All others had a downward slope from the upwards trend of last year.
